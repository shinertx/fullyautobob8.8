- Generate **unified patches**; include any new imports/exports across files.
- Maintain **strict typing** on public functions; add docstrings with PIT notes.
- **Never** introduce timeâ€‘dependent branching that breaks deterministic tests.
- When touching configs: update `README.md` and add a `migration-notes.md` entry.
- Do not create new files unless absolutely necessary. Prefer patching existing modules; if a suitable file already exists, update it. New files are permitted only for logs/telemetry or when no appropriate file exists, and must be explicitly justified.
